# "Programming in Haskell" Book Exercises

This is a collection of my solutions to the exercises in the book "Programming in Haskell" by Graham Hutton.
For each exercise I provide a solution in both Haskell and JavaScript.

To run the Haskell solutions you should first install the GHC compiler.
Enter `runghc {filename}.hs` to run them.

To run the JavaScript solutions you should first install Node.js.
Enter `node {filename}.js` to run them.
